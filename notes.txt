sugestions
-----------
so many buttons on UI makes it overwhelming
herding mechanics for resources
attacking is glitchy
better support for splitting up into multiple groups (option to make another garage?)
better motivation to build multiple hangars/scisormakers


cool features
--------------
double clicking to select all of a cetrain type of unit
lines pointing to destination
